            <h1>Unleash: 4</h1>
            <p>We often hear and see Lumad in news, documentaries, and periodicals depicted as a Filipino minority who experiences abuse <br> and is always forced to go out of their ancestral domains. These stories were all true and are still happening today. However, in this blog, we are going to share their rich and beautiful side. Contrary to what is always portrayed as poor and helpless groups of people, with a new lens, we will look at this group not as someone who always beseeches for help but as Filipinos with their own unique and rich culture. This is not an attempt to conceal the issues faced by the group. We believe that with this vantage point we will better understand their battle cry.</p>

            <h3>They believe in numerous spirits and Gods</h3>
            <p>Lumad depends on signs and omens when farming. They believe that these implicit messages were from the gods of nature and will serve as a help and guide to make a good harvest. Farmers observe their dreams at night. Bad dreams such as getting bitten by a snake or a falling tree are considered bad signs. If this happens, they make a ritual and wait again for good signs in their dreams. And if the bad dream is repeated, the farmer has to look for another area to plant his crops.
                Sunggod-to-Kamanga
                In a ritual called Sunggod-to-Kamanga of Manobo, the amount of rice sticking to the bolo of a farmer signals whether the harvest of the current cropping season is good or bad for the owner of the bolo. If only a small amount of rice sticks to the bolos, people need to offer more rituals and beg for more blessings from the spirits.</p>

            <h3>Signs and omens when farming.</h3>
            <p>When choosing the leader of their community the approach is very traditional. Instead of having an election, they choose their leader based on the consensus of the community. A leader for them must have good leadership skills, financial capacity, wisdom, decision-making ability, articulation, and a good mediator. </p>

                Communal Living
                Lumad is also known for its cooperation and spirit of sharing within its communities. They share their resources like food and even have communal farming in their communities.

        <div class="Learn-col">
            <h3>Herbal doctors and medicines</h3>
            <p>Because of the practice and belief in gods and nature and the inaccessibility of health services, when treating illnesses, most Lumad still depends on herbal medicines and consult herbal doctors. For instance, when the Higaonon gets sick, they consult a small bottle filled with secret herbs called babalaon for diagnosis. The holder of the babalaon will mention several illnesses and if the babalaon moves to a specific name of illness, then that is believed to be the cause of the patient's sickness.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="Learn-col">
            <h3>The land is life and identity</h3>
            <p>Lastly, Lumad is known for their love of their lands. They call it their lupang ninuno or ancestral land. 
                Their love for their land is because of the link between gods and nature. They highly respect and treat their forests and mountains as sacred. Because of this, Lumad is best at taking good care of and maintaining the richness and pristine condition of nature. Their ancestral domains have baganis or warriors for protection against trespassers and those who want to destroy it. In addition to that, they consider land as their life and identity. This is where they live and what keeps them alive as it sustains their daily needs. This is where they practice and preserve their cultures thus stealing it from them means losing their identities. The fact that the indigenous groups withstand the western colonization before and now, it is their fellow Filipinos who will force them to give up their land is a truth that is very hard to swallow.
                
                The cultural values stated are some of the most common to groups under Lumad. Most salient to these cultural values are their closeness to the environment and how in every activity or ceremony they perform rituals. With that in mind, we can now fully understand the root of their resistance and battle against what is being stolen from them.  Aside from that, there are lots of good things that we can learn from them and apply to our lives like the love for the environment and the spirit of sharing. With this blog, we hope that we altered the usual impression about Lumad as a group that always lives in fear. Lumad, like other Filipinos, can be known for its rich and unique culture and values.
